            <strong>12/10/16</strong> - Team Fractals takes 3rd place in second league qualifier!
            After completely rebuilding their robot, Team Fractals scored major points in beacons,
            a strategy they've used this entire season.

            <strong>11/12/16</strong> - Team Fractals takes 10th in their first league qualifier!
            Despite walking into the meet with a malfunctioning robot, the team
            managed to fix the robot in time for the first match. Unfortunately,
            they managed to burn out a motor and encoder, and the robot was not
            functional for one match. A great success for this rookie team!
            <br>
            <strong>10/09/16</strong> - Team Fractals is officially registered as Team #12144 on the
