              <strong>2/?/17</strong> - Team Fractals finishes in place 16/36 in their league! They reached
              their first year goal of top half in their league, and are very optimistic for the future.
              The team has large goals to accomplish over the summer, including building a linear lift, incorporating
              Vuforia image processing, and using new sensors like the gyro and light sensors. The team is off to
              a great start!
            <br>
            <strong>1/14/17</strong> - Team Fractals snags 8th, putting them in 7th in their league.
            The team learned some valuable lessons, and showed great teamwork and perseverance, despite
            a malfunctioning autonomous program. The day started off rough, but the team pulled together
            to reach from last place to 8th.
            <br>
            <strong>1/07/17</strong> - Team Fractals members Daniel Perille and Max Bowman and coaches Keri Bowman
            and Vicki Perille volunteer at Quest's Knights of Tech tournament! They worked as
            queuers.

            <strong>12/10/16</strong> - Team Fractals takes 3rd place in second league qualifier!
            After completely rebuilding their robot, Team Fractals scored major points in beacons,
            a strategy they've used this entire season.
            <br>
            <strong>11/12/16</strong> - Team Fractals takes 10th in their first league qualifier!
            Despite walking into the meet with a malfunctioning robot, the team
            managed to fix the robot in time for the first match. Unfortunately,
            they managed to burn out a motor and encoder, and the robot was not
            functional for one match. A great success for this rookie team!
            <br>
            <strong>10/09/16</strong> - Team Fractals is officially registered as Team #12144 on the
            last possible day to register.
            <br>
            <strong>10/07/16</strong> - Team Fractals is formed over a group chat between
            Daniel J. Perille, Max A. Bowman, and Sevan P. Brodjian.
